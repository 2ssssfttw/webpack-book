# Introduction

The purpose of this cookbook is to guide you into the world of React and Webpack. Both are powerful technologies and when used together, frontend development becomes a joy.

The cookbook should have something to offer for all skill levels. If you are interested in just React, skip the Webpack part and vice versa. A more tutorial oriented approach is available in the form of [SurviveJS - Webpack and React](http://survivejs.com/) book.

## Webpack

Webpack  is a module bundler. In essence it is something that you use to build your project into deliverable components (HTML, CSS, JS). The nice thing about Webpack is that once you initially configure it, it deals with the nasty details for you. This allows you to mix various technologies within your project without a headache.

If you are completely new to Webpack and want to go through a good introduction, check out [Pete Hunt's guide](https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto). You'll find the basics there. This guide merely complements his.
