# Introduction

[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) (or just webpack) simplifies web development by solving a fundamental problem - the problem of bundling. It takes in various assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and then transforms these assets into a format that's easy to consume through a browser.

By doing this well, it takes away significant amount of pain from web development. Given it is a configuration driven tool, it isn't the easiest to learn. But once you understand its fundamentals, it starts to make more sense. The purpose of this guide is just that, to help you get started with Webpack and then go beyond basics.

Big thanks to [Christian Alfoni](http://www.christianalfoni.com/) for helping me to craft the first version. This guide builds heavily on that work. It even inspired this whole SurviveJS effort.
