# Introduction

[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) (or just webpack) simplifies web development by solving a fundamental problem - the problem of bundling. It takes in various assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and then transforms these assets into a format that's easy to consume through a browser. By doing this well, it takes away significant amount of pain from web development.

It isn't the easiest tool to learn due to its configuration driven approach. The purpose of this guide is to help you get started with Webpack and then go beyond basics.
