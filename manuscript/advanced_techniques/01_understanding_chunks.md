# Understanding Chunks

Chunks are one of the most fundamental concepts of webpack. We already touched the topic at the *Splitting Bundles* chapter. There we set up two separate entries, one for the application code and one for our vendor dependencies.

With some additional setup webpack was able to output separate bundles for these. We also did something similar with CSS as we separated it from our code to a bundle of its own in order to improve caching behavior.

## Chunk Types

As [discussed in the documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html#chunk-types), internally webpack treats chunks in three types:

* **Entry chunks** - Entry chunks contain webpack runtime and modules it then loads. So far we've been dealing with these.
* **Normal chunks** - Normal chunks **don't** contain webpack runtime. Instead, these can be loaded dynamically while the application is running. A suitable wrapper (JSONP for example) is generated for these.
* **Initial chunks** - Initial chunks are normal chunks that count towards initial loading time of the application. These are generated by the `CommonsChunkPlugin`. As a user you don't have to care about these. It's the split between entry chunks and normal chunks that's important.

Given we've covered how to deal with entry chunks already, I won't delve into that. Instead, I'm going to show you how to deal with normal chunks. They enable one of the most powerful features of webpack, lazy loading.

## Lazy Loading with Webpack

What makes webpack powerful is its capability of splitting up your application into smaller chunks to load. This is far more flexible than standard concatenation. Even though concatenation works, it's not always a good approach. This is particularly true when the size of your application begins to grow.

Often you don't need all of the dependencies at once. As we saw earlier, you can split your dependencies and benefit from browser caching behavior. This is a good step, but it's not enough always. Your bundles can still be somewhat big. *Lazy loading* allows us to go further.

## Introduction to Lazy Loaded Search with *lunr*

Let's say we want to implement a rough little search for our application without a proper search back-end. We might want to use something like [lunr](http://lunrjs.com/) for generating an index to search against.

The problem is that the index can be quite big depending on the amount of the content. The dumb way to implement this kind of search would be to include the index required to the application bundle itself and then perform search against that.

The good thing is that we don't actually need the search index straight from the start. We can do something more clever. We can start loading the index when the user selects our search field.

This defers the loading and moves it to a place where it's more acceptable. Given the initial search might be slower than the subsequent ones we could display a loading indicator. But that's fine from the user point of view.

### Required Setup

It's going to take some setup to make this work. Assuming you are using Babel for processing, you should have the following dependencies available:

```bash
npm i babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react-hmre -D
```

Especially that `babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import` is important as otherwise [dynamic imports](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) won't work! The rest are specific to this demo. Here's the minimal Babel setup:

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "plugins": ["syntax-dynamic-import"],
  "presets": [
    [
      "es2015",
      {
        "modules": false
      }
    ],
    "react"
  ]
}
```

Note that I have disabled modules from Babel as webpack 2 can handle those.

### Implementing Search with Lazy Loading

Implementing lazy loading is straight-forward. First you will need to decide where to put the split point, put it there, and then handle the `Promise`. The basic `import` looks like `import('./asset').then(asset => ...).catch(err => ...)`.

The nice thing is that this gives us error handling in case something goes wrong (network is down etc.) and gives us a chance to recover. We can also use `Promise` based utilities like `Promise.all` for composing more complicated queries.

In this case we need to detect when the user selects the search element, load the data unless it has been loaded already, and then execute our search logic against it. Using React we could end up with something like this:

**App.jsx**

```javascript
import React from 'react';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      index: null,
      value: '',
      lines: [],
      results: []
    };

    this.onChange = this.onChange.bind(this);
  }
  render() {
    const results = this.state.results;

    return (
      <div className="app-container">
        <div className="search-container">
          <label>Search against README:</label>
          <input
            type="text"
            value={this.state.value}
            onChange={this.onChange} />
        </div>
        <div className="results-container">
          <Results results={results} />
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
  onChange(e) {
    const value = e.target.value;
    const index = this.state.index;
    const lines = this.state.lines;

    // Set captured value to input
    this.setState({
      value
    });

    // Search against lines and index if they exist
    if(lines && index) {
      this.setState({
        results: this.search(lines, index, value)
      });

      return;
    }

    // If the index doesn't exist, we need to set it up.
    // Unfortunately we cannot pass the path so we need to
    // hardcode it (webpack uses static analysis).
    //
    // You could show loading indicator here as loading might
    // take a while depending on the size of the index.
    loadIndex().then(lunr => {
      // Search against the index now.
      this.setState({
        index: lunr.index,
        lines: lunr.lines,
        results: this.search(lunr.lines, lunr.index, value)
      });
    }).catch(err => {
      // Something unexpected happened (connection lost
      // for example).
      console.error(err);
    });
  }
  search(lines, index, query) {
    // Search against index and match README lines
    // against the results.
    return index.search(
      query.trim()
    ).map(
      match => lines[match.ref]
    );
  }
};

const Results = ({results}) => {
  if(results.length) {
    return (<ul>{
      results.map((result, i) => <li key={i}>{result}</li>)
    }</ul>);
  }

  return <span>No results</span>;
};


function loadIndex() {
  // Here's the magic. Set up `import` to tell webpack
  // to split here and load our search index dynamically.
  //
  // Note that you will need to shim Promise.all for
  // older browsers and Internet Explorer!
  return Promise.all([
    import('lunr'),
    import('../search_index.json')
  ]).then(([lunr, search]) => {
    return {
      index: lunr.Index.load(search.index),
      lines: search.lines
    };
  });
}

```

In the example, webpack detects the `import` statically. It is able to generate a separate bundle based on this split point. Given it relies on static analysis, you cannot generalize `loadIndex` in this case and pass the search index path as a parameter.

The approach is useful with routers too. As the user enters some route, you can load the dependencies the resulting view needs. Alternatively you can start loading dependencies as the user scrolls a page and gets near parts with actual functionality. `require.ensure` provides a lot of power and allows you to keep your application lean.

You can find a [full example](https://github.com/survivejs-demos/lunr-demo) showing how it all goes together with lunr, React, and webpack. The basic idea is the same, but there's more setup in place.

T> `import` respects `output.publicPath` option.

T> Incidentally it is possible to implement Google's [PRPL pattern](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/) using lazy loading. PRPL (Push, Render, Pre-cache, Lazy-load) has been designed mobile web in mind and canbe implemented using webpack.

T> In webpack 1 this feature was known as `require.ensure`. Its main handicap was that it was missing proper error handling. It was also more difficult to compose as it wasn't `Promise` based.

## Dynamic Loading with `require.context`

Beyond `import`, there's another type of `require` that you should be aware of. It's [require.context](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/entry-context/#context). `require.context` is a type of `require` which contents aren't known compile-time.

Let's say you are writing a static site generator on top of webpack. You could model your site contents within a directory structure. At the simplest level you could have just a `pages/` directory which would contain Markdown files.

Each of these files would have a YAML frontmatter for their metadata. The url of each page could be determined based on the filename. This is enough information to map the directory as a site. Code-wise we would end up with a statement like this somewhere:

```javascript
// Process pages through `yaml-frontmatter-loader` and `json-loader`.
// The first one extracts the frontmatter and the body and the latter
// converts it into a JSON structure we can use later. Markdown hasn't
// been processed yet.
const req = require.context(
  'json!yaml-frontmatter!./pages',
  true, // Load files recursively. Pass false to skip recursion.
  /^\.\/.*\.md$/ // Match files ending with .md.
);
```

`require.context` returns us a function to `require` against. It also knows its module `id` and it provides a `keys()` method for figuring out the contents of the context. To give you a better example, consider the code below:

```javascript
req.keys(); // ['./demo.md', './another-demo.md']

req.id; // 42

// {title: 'Demo', __content: '# Demo page\nDemo content\n\n'}
const demoPage = req('./demo.md');
```

This information is enough for generating an entire site. And this is exactly what I've done with [Antwar](https://github.com/antwarjs/antwar). You can find a more elaborate example in that static site generator.

The technique can be useful for other purposes, such as testing or adding files for webpack to watch. In that case you would set up a `require.context` within a file which you then point to through a webpack `entry`.

T> Note that webpack will also turn statements written in the form `require('./pages/' + pageName + '.md')` into the `require.context` format!

## Dealing with Dynamic Imports

Given the approaches discussed here rely on static analysis and webpack has to find the files in question, it doesn't work for every possible case. Maybe the assets you need come from somewhere else. Consider using browser-side loaders like [$script.js](https://github.com/ded/script.js/) or [little-loader](https://github.com/walmartlabs/little-loader) on top of webpack in this case.

## Conclusion

Understanding how webpack's chunking works helps you to untap a lot of its power. Just applying `import` alone can be very effective. It opens a world of possibilities. `require.context` has more limited possibilities, but it's a powerful tool especially for tool developers.
