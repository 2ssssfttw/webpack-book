# Code Splitting

Chunks are one of the most fundamental concepts of webpack. We already touched the topic at the *Splitting Bundles* chapter. There we set up two separate entries, one for the application code and one for our vendor dependencies.

With some additional setup webpack was able to output separate bundles for these. We also did something similar with CSS as we separated it from our code to a bundle of its own in order to improve caching behavior.

**Code splitting** is a powerful technique that allows us to go beyond this. Sometimes it might be beneficial to load functionality while we are using an application. Code splitting allows exactly this. We can load bundles on the fly based on some precondition.

## Chunk Types

As [discussed in the documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html#chunk-types), internally webpack treats chunks in three types:

* **Entry chunks** - Entry chunks contain webpack runtime and modules it then loads. So far we've been dealing with these.
* **Normal chunks** - Normal chunks **don't** contain webpack runtime. Instead, these can be loaded dynamically while the application is running. A suitable wrapper (JSONP for example) is generated for these.
* **Initial chunks** - Initial chunks are normal chunks that count towards initial loading time of the application. These are generated by the `CommonsChunkPlugin`. As a user you don't have to care about these. It's the split between entry chunks and normal chunks that's important.

Given we've covered how to deal with entry chunks already, I won't delve into that. Instead, I'm going to show you how to deal with normal chunks as they enable code splitting.

## Code Splitting with Webpack

What makes webpack powerful is its capability of splitting up your application into smaller chunks to load. This is far more flexible than standard concatenation. Even though concatenation works, it's not always a good approach. This is particularly true when the size of your application begins to grow.

Often you don't need all of the dependencies at once. As we saw earlier, you can split your dependencies and benefit from browser caching behavior. This is a good step, but it's not enough always. Your bundles can still be somewhat big. *Lazy loading* allows us to go further.

T> Incidentally it is possible to implement Google's [PRPL pattern](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/) using lazy loading. PRPL (Push, Render, Pre-cache, Lazy-load) has been designed mobile web in mind and canbe implemented using webpack.

### Required Setup

It's going to take some setup to make this work. Assuming you are using Babel for processing, you should have the following dependencies available:

```bash
npm i babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import babel-preset-es2015 -D
```

Especially that `babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import` is important as otherwise [dynamic imports](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) won't work! The rest are specific to this demo. Here's the minimal Babel setup:

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "plugins": ["syntax-dynamic-import"],
  "presets": [
    [
      "es2015",
      {
        "modules": false
      }
    ],
    "react"
  ]
}
```

Note that I have disabled modules from Babel as webpack 2 can handle those.

## Setting Up Code Splitting

TODO: Show how to do dynamic `import` against the project.

T> `import` respects `output.publicPath` option.

T> In webpack 1 this feature was known as `require.ensure`. Its main handicap was that it was missing proper error handling. It was also more difficult to compose as it wasn't `Promise` based.

## Dynamic Loading with `require.context`

Beyond `import`, there's another type of `require` that you should be aware of. It's [require.context](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/entry-context/#context). `require.context` is a type of `require` which contents aren't known compile-time.

Let's say you are writing a static site generator on top of webpack. You could model your site contents within a directory structure. At the simplest level you could have just a `pages/` directory which would contain Markdown files.

Each of these files would have a YAML frontmatter for their metadata. The url of each page could be determined based on the filename. This is enough information to map the directory as a site. Code-wise we would end up with a statement like this somewhere:

```javascript
// Process pages through `yaml-frontmatter-loader` and `json-loader`.
// The first one extracts the frontmatter and the body and the latter
// converts it into a JSON structure we can use later. Markdown hasn't
// been processed yet.
const req = require.context(
  'json-loader!yaml-frontmatter-loader!./pages',
  true, // Load files recursively. Pass false to skip recursion.
  /^\.\/.*\.md$/ // Match files ending with .md.
);
```

`require.context` returns us a function to `require` against. It also knows its module `id` and it provides a `keys()` method for figuring out the contents of the context. To give you a better example, consider the code below:

```javascript
req.keys(); // ['./demo.md', './another-demo.md']

req.id; // 42

// {title: 'Demo', __content: '# Demo page\nDemo content\n\n'}
const demoPage = req('./demo.md');
```

This information is enough for generating an entire site. And this is exactly what I've done with [Antwar](https://github.com/antwarjs/antwar). You can find a more elaborate example in that static site generator.

The technique can be useful for other purposes, such as testing or adding files for webpack to watch. In that case you would set up a `require.context` within a file which you then point to through a webpack `entry`.

T> Note that webpack will also turn statements written in the form `require('./pages/' + pageName + '.md')` into the `require.context` format!

## Dynamic Paths with Dynamic `import`

The same idea works with dynamic `import`. Instead of passing an absolute path, you can pass a partial one. Webpack will set up a context internally. Here's a brief example:

```javascript
// Set up a target or derive this somehow
const target = 'demo.json';

// Elsewhere in code
import(`indexes/${target}).then(...).catch(...);
```

## Dealing with Dynamic Imports

Given the approaches discussed here rely on static analysis and webpack has to find the files in question, it doesn't work for every possible case. Maybe the assets you need come from somewhere else. Consider using browser-side loaders like [$script.js](https://github.com/ded/script.js/) or [little-loader](https://github.com/walmartlabs/little-loader) on top of webpack in this case.

## Conclusion

Understanding how webpack's chunking works helps you to untap a lot of its power. Just applying `import` alone can be very effective. It opens a world of possibilities. `require.context` has more limited possibilities, but it's a powerful tool especially for tool developers.
