# Linting JavaScript

Nothing is easier than making mistakes when coding in JavaScript. Linting is one of those techniques that can help you to make less mistakes. You can spot issues before they become actual problems.

Better yet, modern editors and IDEs offer strong support for popular tools. This means you can spot possible issues as you are developing. Despite this, it is a good idea to set them up with Webpack. That allows you to cancel a production build that might not be up to your standards for example.

## Brief History of Linting in JavaScript

The linter that started it all for JavaScript is Douglas Crockford's [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/). It is opinionated like the man himself. The next step in evolution was [JSHint](http://jshint.com/). It took the opinionated edge out of JSLint and allowed for more customization. [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) is the newest tool in vogue.

### ESLint is Customizable

ESLint goes to the next level as it allows you to implement custom rules, parsers, and reporters. ESLint works with Babel and JSX syntax making it ideal for React projects. It doesn't support JSX by default, though, so a Babel specific parser will need to be used.

ESLint rules have been documented well and you have full control over their severity. These features alone make it a powerful tool. Better yet, there is a large amount of rules and presets beyond the core as the community has built on top of it.

### eslint-config-airbnb

[eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) is a good example of a popular preset. Often it is enough to find a preset you like, tweak it a little bit to your liking with some local rules, or by deriving a preset of your own based on it, and then using that. This way you don't have to worry so much about all the available functionality.

### JSCS Joined the ESLint Project

It is quite telling that a competing project, JSCS, [decided to merge its efforts with ESLint](http://eslint.org/blog/2016/04/welcoming-jscs-to-eslint). JSCS reached end of life with its 3.0.0 release and the core team joined with ESLint.

### Linting is About More than Just Catching Issues

Besides linting for issues, it can be useful to manage the code style on some level. Nothing is more annoying than having to work with source code that has mixed tabs and spaces. Stylistically consistent code reads better and is easier to work with. Linting tools allow you to do this.

Establishing strong linting can be beneficial especially in a context where you need to collaborate with others. Even when working alone you will benefit from linting as it can catch obvious issues you might otherwise neglect. JavaScript as a language allows a lot of usage some of which, while valid, may not be the clearest to understand or may be incorrect even.

Linting does **not** replace proper testing, but it can complement testing approaches. It is one way to harden a codebase and make it a little harder to break. This is particularly important as the size of your project grows and it becomes more challenging to manage.

## Webpack and JSHint

Interestingly, no JSLint loader seems to exist for webpack yet. Fortunately, there's one for JSHint. You could set it up on a legacy project easily. The key is in configuring [jshint-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jshint-loader).

JSHint will look into specific rules to apply from `.jshintrc`. You can also define custom settings within a `jshint` object at your webpack configuration. Exact configuration options have been covered at [the JSHint documentation](http://jshint.com/docs/) in detail.

## Setting Up ESLint

![ESLint](images/eslint.png)

[ESLint](http://eslint.org/) is the most versatile linting solution for JavaScript. It builds on top of ideas presented by JSLint and JSHint. More importantly it allows you to develop custom rules. As a result, a nice set of rules have been developed for React in the form of [eslint-plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react).

T> Since *v1.4.0* ESLint supports a feature known as [autofixing](http://eslint.org/blog/2015/09/eslint-v1.4.0-released/). It allows you to perform certain rule fixes automatically. To activate it, pass the flag `--fix` to the tool. It is also possible to use this feature with Webpack, although you should be careful with it.

### Connecting ESlint with *package.json*

To get started, install ESLint as a development dependency:

```bash
npm i eslint --save-dev
```

This will add ESLint as our project development dependency. Next, we'll need to do some configuration so we can run ESLint easily through npm. I am using the `test` namespace to signify it's a testing related task. I am also enabling caching to improve performance on subsequent runs. Add the following:

**package.json**

```json
...
"scripts": {
leanpub-start-insert
  "test:lint": "eslint . --cache",
leanpub-end-insert
  "start": "webpack-dev-server --env development",
  "build": "webpack --env production"
},
...
```

Given ESLint expects configuration to work, we need to define some. It relies on rules that tell what to lint and how to react if the rule isn't obeyed. The severity of an individual rule is defined by a number as follows:

* 0 - The rule has been disabled.
* 1 - The rule will emit a warning.
* 2 - The rule will emit an error.

Some rules, such as `quotes`, accept an array instead. This allows you to pass extra parameters to them. Refer to the [ESLint rules documentation](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/) for specifics.

Here's a starting point that will work with our project:

**.eslintrc.js**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "commonjs": true,
    "es6": true,
    "node": true
  },
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "parserOptions": {
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "rules": {
    "indent": [
      "error",
      2
    ],
    "linebreak-style": [
      "error",
      "unix"
    ],
    "quotes": [
      "error",
      "single"
    ],
    "semi": [
      "error",
      "always"
    ],
    "no-unused-vars": [
      "warn"
    ]
  }
};
```

In addition we need to tell ESLint to skip linting possible *build* directory by setting up ignore patterns:

**.eslintignore**

```bash
build/
```

T> You can point ESLint to your Git ignores through `--ignore-path .gitignore`. It also accepts individual patterns, through `--ignore-pattern <pattern>`.

If you invoke `npm run test:lint` now, you should see a single warning:

```bash
  28:27  warning  'env' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars

âœ– 1 problem (0 errors, 1 warning)
```

If you see more, fix them. We'll fix this one when we add more configuration in place.

Beyond vanilla JSON, ESLint supports other formats, such as JavaScript or YAML. If you want to use a different format, name the file accordingly. I.e., *.eslintrc.yaml* would expect YAML. See the [documentation](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#configuration-file-formats) for further details.

T> ESLint supports ES6 features through configuration. You will have to specify the features to use through the [ecmaFeatures](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring.html#specifying-language-options) property.

T> There are useful plugins, such as [eslint-plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react), [eslint-plugin-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-promise) , and [eslint-plugin-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import), that you might want to consider integrating to your project.

### Generating a Starting Point

Sometimes you might want to rely on some existing preset or set up custom configuration. That's where `--init` can come in handy. You can run it from `npm bin` and you'll end up with a call like `node_modules/.bin/eslint --init`

T> ESLint supports custom formatters through `--format` parameter. [eslint-friendly-formatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-friendly-formatter) is an example of a formatter that provides terminal friendly output. This way you can jump conveniently straight to the warnings and errors from there.

T> You can get more performance out of ESLint by running it through a daemon, such as [eslint_d](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint_d). Using it brings down the overhead and it can bring down linting times considerably.

### Connecting ESLint with Babel

In case you want to lint against custom language features that go beyond standard ES6, use [babel-eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-eslint). Install the parser first:

```bash
npm i babel-eslint --save-dev
```

Change *.eslintrc.js* like this so that ESLint knows to use the custom parser over the default one:

**.eslintrc.js**

```json
module.exports = {
  ...
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
leanpub-start-delete
  "parserOptions": {
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
leanpub-end-delete
leanpub-start-insert
  "parser": "babel-eslint",
leanpub-end-insert
  ...
};
```

### Connecting ESLint with Webpack

We can make Webpack emit ESLint messages for us by using [eslint-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-loader). As the first step execute

```bash
npm i eslint-loader --save-dev
```

W> Note that `eslint-loader` will use a globally installed version of ESLint unless you have one included with the project itself! Make sure you have ESLint as a development dependency to avoid strange behavior.

You can set it up as below to make sure the linter gets executed before the other code. This way we'll know early of if our code fails to lint during development. It is useful to include linting to the production target of your project as well.

**webpack.parts.js**

```javascript
...

exports.lintJavaScript = function(paths) {
  return {
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.js$/,
          include: paths,

          use: 'eslint-loader',
          enforce: 'pre'
        }
      ]
    }
  };
};
```

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
const common = merge(
  {
    entry: {
      app: PATHS.app
    },
    output: {
      path: PATHS.build,
      filename: '[name].js'
    },
    plugins: [
      new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        title: 'Webpack demo'
      })
    ]
leanpub-start-delete
  }
leanpub-end-delete
leanpub-start-insert
  },
  parts.lintJavaScript(PATHS.app)
leanpub-end-insert
);
```

If you execute `npm start` now and break some linting rule while developing, you should see that in the terminal output. The same should happen when you build the project.

T> Especially on bigger projects it may be beneficial to run ESLint outside of webpack. That keeps code compilation fast while still giving the advantage of linting. Solutions like [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) and [fastlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastlint) can make this even faster.

T> Most IDEs and editors have good ESLint integration so you can spot issues as you develop. This applies to other linting tools as well.

T> To learn how to write an ESLint plugin, check out the *Writing ESLint Plugins* appendix for more information. The *Customizing ESLint* appendix digs deeper into customization options and further resources.

## EditorConfig

[EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) allows you to maintain a consistent coding style across different IDEs and editors. Some even come with built-in support. For others, you have to install a separate plugin. In addition to this you'll need to set up a file like this:

**.editorconfig**

```yaml
root = true

# General settings for whole project
[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4

end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true

# Format specific overrides
[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = false

[app/**.js]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
```

## Conclusion

In this chapter, you learned how to lint your code using webpack in various ways. It is one of those techniques that yields benefits over the long term. You can fix possible problems before they become actual issues.

In the next chapter we'll learn how to deal with styling using webpack. We can also resume setting up HMR there and learn to drop unused CSS from our project.
